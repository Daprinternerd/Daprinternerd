# Hi there ðŸ‘‹
## ðŸš€ About Me

 Hello! My name is Thomas Gile, I am a young maker, 3d printer enthusist, *and hopfully a good coder in the future* ðŸ˜Š

I love learning a ton about 3d printer design generally cool projects. I recently joined Hackclub.com which is a crazy resource for teenagers, if you want to join (You gotta be a teen tho! Sorry for the adults out there ðŸ˜£ ) it has a wonderful community of like minded kids. I "recently" joined one of their programs: highway.hackclub.com and built two 3d printers in CAD (One was a bust but the [second](https://github.com/Daprinternerd/G1-Ghost-Mini) one is amazing): I just got my funding to build it so the rabbithole begins!

I will be spending a lot of time on the **G1 Mini 3d Printer** (already spent 120+ hours) to make it as polished as possible, as well as releasing a Pro Version (basically the same printer but with every feature I couldn't add for budgetary reasons), a toolhead ecosystem, and a mmu unit. I have this whole plan, for like a system of projects that work together like the **GHOST** series (Printers), the **PHANTOM** series (Toolheads), and the **GHOUL** series (a mmu and accessories) and more.
